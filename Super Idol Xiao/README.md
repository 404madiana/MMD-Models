## Lightmap edit
You may copy the fx folder of Manashiku's shader to use the lightmapped model, i named mine `manashader`.
<br>cuz i have no right to redistribute the entire folder so.. ¯\ _(ツ)_/¯

Manashiku's shader:
	https://github.com/Manashiku/MMDGenshin
<br>No need for the model texture application, i already did it for you :)

## MikuMikuEffect
- added AutoLuminous4 settings for element parts of his body

Find the effect and download the folder in this gallery:
