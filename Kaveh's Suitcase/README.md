<br>Rigged from [YelanLover's site](https://3d.yelan.love/)

> __Note__
<br>Consider this as a beta, i'm still working on UV remap for Grain materials...
<br>And apologies for the shadow i couldn't do much about itðŸ’€

## Edits by mad_iana:
- added morphs for eyes
- open case feature. The inside is the core color, might look like this:
<br>Diffuse: $\textcolor{rgb(128, 139, 41)}{\textsf{HSL(44, 131, 85) or RGB(128, 139, 41)}}$
<br>Ambient: $\textcolor{rgb(114, 124, 56)}{\textsf{HSL(46, 91, 85) or RGB(114, 124, 56)}}$
- added grain material to spawn Mehrak
- added setting for AutoLuminious effect

## MikuMikuEffect - AutoLuminous4

Find the effect and download the folder in this gallery:

<br>Once loaded the effect, go to `MMEffect` menu then <code>Effect mapping</code>,
<br>choose `AL_Emitter` tab and select `Mehrak.pmx`,
<br>go to `File(F)` and click on `Open by Model`, then select `Mehrak AL` file. ðŸŽ‰
<br>If you want to light the model correctly, you need to set `Si` to lower than `0.2000` in **Accessory manipulation**.
