## Edits by mad_iana:
- added primogem material
- removed finger bones to fit in primogem material
- fixed her legs so no more random fragment in the primogem
- split element parts for AutoLuminous MME
- renamed facial morphs

## Lightmap edit
You may copy the fx folder of Manashiku's shader to use the lightmapped model, i named mine "manashader".
<br>cuz i have no right to redistribute the entire folder so.. ¯\ _(ツ)_/¯

Manashiku's shader:

<br>No need for the model texture application, i already did it for you :)

## MikuMikuEffect
- added AutoLuminous4 settings for element parts of his body

Find the effect and download the folder in this gallery:
