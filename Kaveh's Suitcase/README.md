Model provided by **miHoYo (HoYoverse)**
<br>Rigged from [YelanLover's site](https://3d.yelan.love/)

## Edits by mad_iana:
- added morphs for eyes
- open case feature. The inside is the core color, might look like this:
<br>Diffuse: $\textcolor{rgb(128, 139, 41)}{\textsf{HSL(44, 131, 85) or RGB(128, 139, 41)}}$
<br>Ambient: $\textcolor{rgb(114, 124, 56)}{\textsf{HSL(46, 91, 85) or RGB(114, 124, 56)}}$
- added grain material to spawn Mehrak
- added setting for AutoLuminious effect

## MikuMikuEffect - AutoLuminous4
- added AutoLuminous4 settings for element parts of his body

Once loaded the effect, go to `MMEffect` menu then <code>Effect mapping</code>,
				<br>choose <code>AL_Emitter</code> tab and select <code>Mehrak.pmx</code>,
				<br>go to <code>File(F)</code> and click on <code>Open by Model</code>, then select <code>Mehrak AL</code> file. ðŸŽ‰
If you want to light the model correctly, you need to set <code>Si</code> to < <code>0.2000</code> in <b>Accessory manipulation</b>

<br>Consider this as a beta, i'm still working on UV remap for Grain materials...
<br>And apologies for the shadow i couldn't do much about itðŸ’€

**Please contact me if you have done any improvement such as material reweight, UV remap, etc. so i would update the model here.**
